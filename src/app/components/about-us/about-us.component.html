          Hello, my name is Sasha. I am 28 years old. I live in the city of Minsk. I have a higher education by specialty "automation engineer".
           However, I did not work in my specialty.
           I worked as an assistant master in the printing industry.
           In my free time I like to listen to music, ride a bicycle, scooter, go for walks, and also meet with friends.
           In the future, I hope to find a job in the information technology field.
           Responsible for the login page, catalog page, shopping cart page.
           Came up with the project logic that is used in our project. Organized group calls to discuss the current state of affairs.
          <br />There is only one god, and his name is Comments in the Code. And we tell the Commentaries in the Code
          only one thing: “Not today.”
